Potatoes' Soup is a much of mixed ingredients to make your H3VR game a lot better!

Full list of additions/changes

##### Bolt Bracing
- Holding the bolt back on a gun and letting go of the foregrip and grip while shouldering the gun will keep it in place, freeing up one hand while leaving the bolt open
- Works on both Bolt Action rifles and Closed Bolt guns
- Does not work with charging handles
##### Bullet Thumbing
- Holding down the touchpad while racking the slide of a gun will "thumb" the bullet in the chamber if it is not fired, inserting it back into the magazine instead of ejecting it.
- Works with Closed Bolt guns and Bolt Action rifles
- Does not work if using a charging handle
##### Clear Stabilization
- Two-hand stabilizing a gun will now not display your offhand
- Can be disabled in the config
##### Double Action Revolver Decocking
- Holding down the touchpad while pulling the trigger on a cocked double action will now decock the revolver
##### Laser Pointer Patch
- The size of a laser's red dot is no longer dependant on the distance between the dot and the gun, but on the distance between the dot and the player. (In the base game, the laser pointer being very far away will cause the dot to be very big if you are near the dot.)
##### Bolt Action Manipulation
- Up on the touchpad now cocks the hammer
